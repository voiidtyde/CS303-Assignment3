Part 1:
When running the code, you will be asked to enter an infix expression. Input an expression with balanced parenthesis to convert it to a postfix expression. The example used in the screenshot is "(2 + 3) * (5 - 1)", where the parenthesis are then removed and the operators and operands are organized. 

Part 2:
After the postfix expression is generated. A series of tests for the Queue will be performed. First, the queue will be created and numbers "1, 2, and 3" will be put into the queue. Then, isEmpty is tested in an if statement that should evaluate to true showing that it is not empty, and then the front element in the queue will be returned. Finally, the queue will dequeue the elements one by one and print them out as they are removed as shown in the screenshot.
